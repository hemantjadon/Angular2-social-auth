# Angular2 Social-Auth

The goal is to build a set of high-quality Authentication component and services built with Angular 2 and TypeScript.

The goal is also to build the components for all the OAuth providers.

## What is meant by "high-quality" : 
  * Straightforward APIs that don't confuse developers.
  * Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
  * Performance cost is minimized.

All the contributions are welcomed. :)
